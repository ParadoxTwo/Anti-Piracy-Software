# Anti-Piracy-Software
This is the Software Part of anti piracy system. 
The software is a game (https://github.com/hexadeciman/Snake) with anti-piracy codes embedded in it.
It runs on the client side.
It is initially dependant on the server but later is independent of it and instead depends only on blockchain.
In this project, ropsten testnet is used.
It is installed in the system using the setup:
